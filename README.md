### Ngx-Admin Angular 8 application from akveo.com

This is modified and more lightweight version of original application to practice UI Automation with Cypress.

The original repo is here: https://github.com/akveo/ngx-admin

# Getting started

Make sure you have the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli#installation) installed globally. We use [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) to manage the dependencies. Run `npm install --force` to resolve all dependencies (might take a minute). Use `--force flag`

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Testing the project

Run `npx cypress open` and choose a test to run.

### Building the project

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
